			<td>AnimeJapan 2022</td>
			<td>As Sky approaches its third anniversary, one of the places the game will go this March is onstage at AnimeJapan 2022, and we’re delighted for this opportunity to share some of our plans for the year.Renowned Japanese voice actor and artist Yuki Kaji joins us on stage on March 27th local time as we give a look behind the scenes of our next Season and discuss news about other events and projects we’re working on in the months ahead. For those who are able to safely attend in Tokyo, we’ll also have a Sky-themed booth and activities to welcome visitors and bring a bit of Sky beyond our screens.</td>

			<td>0.16.5 Update</td>
			<td>Days of Bloom
			The snow drifts in Home will soon be melting, which means that blossoms will soon rise and unfurl for the return of this year’s Days of Bloom! A new tree draped in soft, brilliant Light will appear in one of the realms, and a group of Spirits returns from a past Season to gather in its splendor. 
			Thank you, Kizuna AI
			One of our hopes in Sky is that players can build ties of friendship no matter where they are in the world. Building these ties has also been key for virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI—whose name in Japanese reference connections and love. With these shared aims, Kizuna AI China joined part of our community briefly after Sky’s launch in 2019 for a small collaboration that aimed to celebrate these connections.</td>

			<td>Gather for Days of Fortune</td>
			<td>Home is the center of this merry gathering. Players can meet the Auspicious Visitor event Spirit on a brightly lit pier—and help welcome their companions who will join them over the first week. During the second week, a fireworks show will provide a vivid backdrop for games with friends and dance parties for Spirits and Sky children alike. Last year’s felicitous figure also returns, periodically appearing in Home to gift items for players to ignite that will emit up to a certain amount of Light to collect each day.</td>

				Venture into the Deep: Season of Abyss

			<td>
				Long ago, a crew of savvy scavengers set sail to the outer reaches of Golden Wasteland, hoping to discover long-forgotten treasures hidden beneath the waves. The Season of Abyss now approaches, and starting from 00:00 am January 17th (all times PST, UTC-8), players in turn can seek the mysteries and surprises that await in the sapphire depths of Sky’s newest Season.
