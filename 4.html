		<p id="U4">With the Easter holiday approaching, baby ducklings often find their way into gift baskets, but with some forethought, knowledge, and planning these little darlings can become treasured members of the family. Here is some useful information for those who might be considering a duck as a pet. Ducks are wonderfully hardy, inexpensive, and easy to care for. They can live up to 20 years and make gentle and amusing pets.</p>

	<center><p id="U6">The call duck is a breed of domesticated duck raised primarily for decoration or as pets. Call ducks look similar to some other duck breeds, but are smaller in size. Call ducks were initially used in hunting, where their own calls and quacks—which are characteristically high in pitch as a result of their small size, and especially loud[1]—would attract wild ducks towards the hunter. This practice has almost entirely been replaced with artificial duck calls, with call ducks now being kept primarily as pets.</p></center>
